## *App Name: PinPoints Travel Application*

### *Description*
PinPoints is a travel-based social game designed to help travelers share real, community-driven insights from all around the world.

As a frequent traveler myself, I’ve often struggled with the lack of honest, up-to-date information about certain destinations. That’s why I created this app, it’s the kind of tool I wish existed during my own travels.

With PinPoints, users can drop notes that include photos, tips, and must-know facts at specific locations, turning every adventure into a chance to help others. Whether it’s a hidden gem, a local warning, or just a favorite coffee shop, every note can help other travelers.

Users using the application have the ability to sign up for a new account, add a new note, edit a note, and delete a note.

### *Next Steps* 
* If I could go back in time, I would change how I did my schema. Embedding the notes schema into the destination schema challenged me but also made this way more complicated than it needed to be. My first next step would be to re-do my model schema.
* I'd like to add the ability to see what notes you have created on your profile page.
* I want users to be able to see what note they have favorited.
* I'd like the ability to add friends and connect with other travelers
* I'd also like a search ability for different notes and filter notes by cities in destinations.
